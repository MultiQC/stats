# MultiQC Stats

Automated statistics to plot MultiQC contributions over time.

## Modules over time

This plot is generated by looping over repository commits and counting the number of files in the MultiQC modules directory.

## Contributors over time

This plot is generated by looping over commits to the main MultiQC repository and counting when a new contributor either contributes a commit, or co-authors a commit. The latter is found in commit messages and is needed for 2025 onwards, when MultiQC adopted a squash-merge strategy.
